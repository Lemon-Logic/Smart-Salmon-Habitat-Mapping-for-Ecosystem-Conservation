# Smart-Salmon-Habitat-Mapping-for-Ecosystem-Conservation

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project focuses on using AI and remote sensing to develop a smart salmon habitat mapping system. The system provides real-time insights into changing salmon habitats, aiding in the conservation and management of salmon populations.

## Background

Salmon populations are directly affected by changes in habitat conditions, such as water quality, temperature, and food availability. Real-time changes can be difficult to track when using traditional habitat mapping methods. This project aims to address this issue by using AI and remote sensing to create a smart habitat mapping system.

Problems Addressed:

1. Difficulty in real-time monitoring of changing salmon habitats.
2. Lack of efficient tools for habitat mapping, conservation, and management.
3. Insufficient data for timely conservation actions.

## How is it used?

The smart salmon habitat mapping system is designed to provide real-time data to fisheries managers, environmental agencies, and researchers. It aids in monitoring the status of salmon habitats, offering insights into changes that might affect salmon populations. The system is particularly useful in the following contexts:

- Monitoring salmon habitat conditions during spawning seasons.
- Identifying potential threats to salmon habitats in real-time.
- Guiding habitat restoration efforts and conservation strategies.

Users of the system include environmental agencies, fisheries management organizations, researchers, and conservationists. It fulfills their needs for timely, accurate, and actionable data to protect salmon populations and their ecosystems.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources for the project include satellite imagery, underwater sensors, and environmental monitoring stations. The AI techniques employed in the project include machine learning, image analysis, and data processing. The AI system will process data from these sources to create habitat maps that show the distribution of salmon-friendly areas, identify changes over time, and predict potential threats to habitats.

## Challenges

The project does not address the physical restoration of habitats, which may require separate initiatives. It is important to recognize that AI models may have limitations in certain environmental conditions, and the project must account for potential inaccuracies in habitat mapping.

Ethical considerations include responsible data collection and privacy in remote sensing applications.

## What next?

The project can grow by integrating IoT devices for real-time data collection and by involving local communities in habitat monitoring. It can also be extended to map habitats of other aquatic species, contributing to broader ecosystem conservation efforts.
